If you are located outside the United Kingdom and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the data, including Personal Data, to the United Kingdom and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
 
ECOZE will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other personal information.
 
It is important to note that ECOZE complies with the GDPR standards for users in the European Economic Area (EEA). In cases of data transfer out of the EEA, we ensure similar protection and take steps to ensure that the transfer is lawful and safe. This may involve the use of data protection agreements, ensuring the entities receiving the data meet GDPR standards or follow recognized European data protection adequacy decisions.

Our Service is not intended for children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 18.
